## Section 1: Identify the network protocol involved in the incident
The initial protocol involved in the incident is DNS (Domain Name System), used to resolve the domain name to an IP address. Following that, the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used to request data from the web server. The malware file is transferred via HTTP.

## Section 2: Document the incident

After formal complaints were submitted via helpdesk, users reported experiencing slowness on their machines after downloading a file supposedly required to access the company site "yummyrecipesforme.com."

Attempts were made by the administrator to access the server, but both the user and administrator accounts had their credentials altered.

In response, the security team initiated an analysis within a sandbox environment to avoid compromising other company operations. The objective was to use the tcpdump tool to analyze network traffic.

During testing, the analyst observed that when making a DNS request, the server initially responded with the correct IP. However, after a few attempts, the server returned a different IP, redirecting the user to download a file.

It was identified that the website's source code had been modified to force the download of a malicious software. Additionally, the administrator reported incorrect credentials, leading the team to suspect that the attack involved a brute force attempt.

All downloads performed compromised the computers that downloaded the malicious file.

## Section 3: Recommend one or more remediations for brute force attacks

A recommended security measure would be to implement strict password policies and regular user training. Users should be instructed to change their passwords frequently, using strong combinations that include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) should be considered. With 2FA, even if an attacker manages to obtain the password through brute force, they would still require a second form of authentication to access the system, such as a code sent via SMS or generated by an app. This approach is effective, particularly considering that the attacker exploited a default password, a vulnerability that can easily be avoided with these security practices.
